# Network Scanning Results
The initial subnet scan successfully identified the IP address of the target machine, Metasploitable 2, as 192.168.111.148. 
Subsequent port scanning revealed that 30 ports were open. 
A more aggressive scan was then conducted, uncovering the software versions associated with each service running on the open ports.

The following services were found to be accessible:

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
SSH (Secure Shell)
Telnet
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
DNS (Domain Name System)
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
RPCBind
NetBIOS
Microsoft-DS
Exec
Login
Shell
RMIRegistry
Ingres
These services provide potential entry points for further exploitation, with their software versions offering insight into potential vulnerabilities.
