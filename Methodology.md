# Methodology

## Reconnaissance:
Initial information gathering was conducted to identify the target's IP address and open ports using Nmap. 
This phase provided an overview of the available services running on the Metasploitable 2 machine.

## Scanning:
A more detailed scan was performed to identify service versions and the operating system. 
Aggressive and scripted scanning methods within Nmap were used to gather detailed information about the target environment.

## Exploitation:
Several vulnerabilities were identified across various services. 
These vulnerabilities were subsequently exploited using Metasploit, allowing further access to the target system.

## Reporting:
This report provides comprehensive documentation, including proof of concept, detailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities identified, corresponding CVE references, and a full walkthrough of the exploitation process.

## Tools Used:
Nmap: For network scanning and service enumeration.
Metasploit: For exploiting identified vulnerabilities.
